After a long while, I decided to write again. About what I'm not sure yet. One of the best reasons I can come up with is that I probably should, since during work and other normal activities, I'm always wondering about some many things.

Anyway, I feel that the most common topic will be about code since It's after all the thing that attracts me the most nowadays. I do other stuff as well, like reading, watching movies and series, cycling and traveling. I feel that every human nowadays do the same thing, generally.

To kickstart this again, I'm going to be using a nice tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
